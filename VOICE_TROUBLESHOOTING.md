# 🎤 Voice Recognition Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ **Voice Issues RESOLVED!**

### **What Was Wrong**
- Audio packages (Whisper, sounddevice, soundfile) were not installed
- This caused voice input to be completely disabled

### **What We Fixed**
```bash
# Installed missing packages:
pip install openai-whisper sounddevice soundfile pyaudio TTS
```

## 🚀 **Current Voice Status**

### ✅ **Now Working**
- ✅ **Speech-to-Text**: Whisper model loaded successfully
- ✅ **Audio Recording**: sounddevice package available
- ✅ **Japanese Recognition**: Forced to Japanese language (`ja`)
- ✅ **Voice Input Button**: Now visible in web interface
- ✅ **Text-to-Speech**: TTS package installed

### 🎯 **How to Use Voice Features**

1. **Open the web app**: http://localhost:8503
2. **Look for**: "🎤 音声入力" section (now visible!)
3. **Click**: "🎙️ 音声で話す" button
4. **Speak in Japanese** for 5 seconds (adjustable slider)
5. **Wait**: For transcription and AI response

## 🔧 **If Voice Still Not Working**

### **Check Microphone Permissions**
```bash
# Windows: Settings > Privacy > Microphone
# Allow apps to access microphone
```

### **Test Audio Devices**
```bash
# Check available audio devices
python -c "import sounddevice; print(sounddevice.query_devices())"
```

### **Test Whisper Directly**
```bash
# Test if Whisper can load
python -c "import whisper; model = whisper.load_model('base'); print('✅ Whisper working!')"
```

### **Common Issues**

1. **"No microphone found"**
   - Check microphone is connected and enabled
   - Check Windows microphone permissions

2. **"Recording failed"**
   - Try different audio device
   - Check microphone levels in Windows settings

3. **"Transcription failed"**
   - Speak clearly in Japanese
   - Check internet connection (some models need it)
   - Try increasing recording duration

4. **"Audio device busy"**
   - Close other audio applications
   - Restart the browser/app

## 🎌 **Japanese Voice Tips**

- **Speak clearly** in Japanese
- **Natural pace** (not too fast/slow)
- **5-10 seconds** works best
- **Quiet environment** for better recognition
- **Close to microphone** for clearer audio

## 🎊 **Success!**

Your voice recognition should now be working perfectly!
